# GMonitor

This extension fixes the poor framerate that is encountered when running GameMaker <= 2.3.1 games on monitors with refresh rates higher than 60Hz.

## Getting Started
### Installation via Local Package (.yymps)

GameMaker Studio 2 allows you to import assets, including scripts and shaders, directly into your project via the "Local Package" system. From the [Releases](https://github.com/DatZach/GMonitor/releases) tab for this repo, download the .yymps file for the latest version. In the GMS2 IDE, load up your project and click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu then import all extensions from the GMonitor package.

## Usage
Simply import the extension and that's all! All the work will be done for you automatically.

## Future Plans
 - Fix issues with slowdowns related to monitors that implement NVidia G-Sync.
